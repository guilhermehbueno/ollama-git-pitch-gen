### Instruction:
- Respond **only** with the commit message.
- Do **not** include an introduction, explanation, or commentary.
- The message must be **clear, concise, and follow best practices**.

### Task:
Generate a **concise and meaningful Git commit message** summarizing the following changes.

### Context:
- The commit message should use an **imperative tone** (e.g., "Fix bug in login").
- Do **not** include phrases like "This commit" or "Here is your message".
- Keep it **under 72 characters** for the subject line (if more details are needed, break them into a body section).
- Follow **Git commit best practices** (e.g., Conventional Commits).
- Identify **whether changes are additions, deletions, or modifications**, and reflect this in the message.

---

### **Change Classification:**
- If code **was added**, use **"Add", "Introduce", or "Implement"**.
- If code **was removed**, use **"Remove", "Delete", or "Deprecate"**.
- If code **was modified**, use **"Update", "Refactor", or "Fix"**.
- If a **config file changed**, mention the key settings updated.

---

### **User Clarification:**
If the user has provided additional context, integrate it meaningfully into the commit message.

### **Diff Analysis Guidelines:**
- **Highlight Additions**: Identify new code, functions, or features.
- **Highlight Deletions**: Explicitly recognize removed functionality.
- **Summarize Significant Changes**: If the diff is large, prioritize key changes.
- **Categorize the Change**: Use the appropriate Conventional Commit prefix:
  - **feat:** for new features
  - **fix:** for bug fixes
  - **chore:** for non-functional updates
  - **refactor:** for code restructuring
  - **docs:** for documentation updates
